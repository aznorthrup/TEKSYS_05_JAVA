This application uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create a responsive and (relatively) clean user interface. It also utilizes JSON and local storage to allow a user to maintain information when leaving the page. There is a feedback section which, in a live environment, would send an email with questions comments or concern directly to the listed email address. A simple CSS animation allows the pages to fade in.
